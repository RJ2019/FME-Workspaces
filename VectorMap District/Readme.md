How to Use
===========

This VMD loader is designed for loading the shapefile tiles you can download from OS Opendata. 

Basically this workspace does one thing - it tries to clean the data.  We've found quite a bit of data is geometrically invalid. This tries to fix that. Otherwise it's a standard loader.
